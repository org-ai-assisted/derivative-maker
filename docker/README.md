With the convenience of a debian:trixie docker container, `derivative-maker-docker` automatically builds Whonix/Kicksecure images, incorporating the official derivative-maker build scripts, while including environment variables and intuitive ways to customize every available build option, container behavior and final build command. Additionally, log files of the entire build, git and key verification process are automatically generated. All necessary files already ship with the current derivative-maker source code, allowing for quick and simple deployment with a variety of pre-defined user scripts.

## Roadmap
- [x] Read documentation
- [ ] Install docker engine
- [ ] Clone derivative-maker
- [ ] Docker image
- [ ] Choose container parameters
- [ ] Craft a build command
- [ ] Deploy the container
    - [ ] Standard
    - [ ] Custom


## Script Overview
|  Name                                             | Description              | Location
| --------------------------------------------------| -------------------------|------------|
| derivative-maker-docker-setup | Prepares minimal debian env in the docker image | container:/usr/bin
| derivative-maker-docker-run| Creates volumes and starts the container | host:derivative-maker/docker
| derivative-maker-docker-start| Executes any given build command  | container:/usr/bin
| entrypoint.sh | Initializes systemd and allows services to be started | container:/usr/bin

## Usage
- [x] Install docker engine
- [x] Cloning derivative-maker
- [x] (Re)build the docker image
### Docker Image
1. Locate your [desired tag](https://github.com/Whonix/derivative-maker/tags)
2. Clone it
   ```sh
   git clone --depth=1 --branch 17.3.9.9-stable --jobs=4 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/Whonix/derivative-maker.git
   ```
3. The docker image is automatically generated
  + Checking current image status
    ```sh
    docker images
    ```
  + Trigger re-creation by deleting the current image
    ```
    docker rmi -f derivative-maker/derivative-maker-docker:latest
    ```

### Multi-arch builds (arm64, amd64, ...)
The Dockerfile is arch-agnostic: `FROM debian:trixie-slim` is a multi-arch
manifest list, and arch-specific packages (e.g. `grub-efi-arm64`,
`grub-efi-amd64`) are pulled in by `build-steps.d/1100_sanity-tests` at
**build time** based on `--arch`, not baked into the image. To target a
specific platform, pass `--platform` to buildx:
```sh
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t derivative-maker/derivative-maker-docker:latest ./docker
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t derivative-maker/derivative-maker-docker:latest ./docker
```
The image's apt is pinned to the same snapshot.debian.org timestamp a
`--freshness frozen` build uses, so the tools installed in the image and the
packages the build resolves come from one snapshot. That configuration is static,
in `docker/apt/`, and is COPY'd in by the `Dockerfile` -- a hand-run
`docker build`/`buildx build` therefore gets the pin with no extra flag.

`dm-update-frozen-snapshot` rewrites the timestamp in `docker/apt/debian.sources`
together with `build_sources/debian_stable_frozen_clearnet.sources` and the plain
`build_sources/frozen-snapshot-timestamp`, and refuses to bump when the three
disagree. Do not hand-edit one of them.

`derivative-maker-docker-run` stamps the image with the pin
(`org.kicksecure.derivative-maker.frozen-snapshot`) and rebuilds when the label no
longer matches, so a bump cannot silently reuse an image built from the previous
snapshot.
On Apple Silicon hosts, the default platform already matches
(`linux/arm64`); no extra flags needed. Cross-arch builds require
`qemu-user-static` registered with binfmt_misc.

### Volumes
1. By default three folders are generated in the user's home directory
   ```sh
   BINARY_VOLUME="$HOME/binary_mnt"
   CACHER_VOLUME="$HOME/approx_cache_mnt"
   KEY_VOLUME="$HOME/.key_mnt"
   ```
  + `BINARY_VOLUME` is the location of build artifacts and logs
  + `CACHER_VOLUME` is the mount point of the container's `/var/cache/apt-cacher-ng`
  * `KEY_VOLUME` is the mount point of the container's `/home/user/.gnupg`
2. To change folder names or locations use the container params `--*-mount`
### Container parameters
- [x] Choose container parameters
- [x] (Optional) Add custom volumes

|  Option     | Description              | Sample Value
| ------------| -------------------------|------------|
| `--binary-mount` | Configure custom binary artifact directory | /home/user/whonix/dm-binary
| `--cacher-mount` | Configure custom package cache directory | /home/user/whonix/apt-cache
| `--key-mount` | Configure custom keystore directory | /home/user/whonix/keys

The command to run in the container is explicit, after `--`.
#### Sample Commands
1. Build a Kicksecure or Whonix image
   ```sh
   ./derivative-maker-docker-run -- ./derivative-maker <build arguments>
   ```
2. Execute a specific build-step
   ```sh
   ./derivative-maker-docker-run -- build-steps.d/3600_convert-raw-to-iso <build arguments>
   ```
3. Run a custom command (e.g. an interactive shell)
   ```sh
   ./derivative-maker-docker-run -- bash
   ```
4. Choose custom volume mount points
   ```sh
   ./derivative-maker-docker-run --binary-mount /home/user/whonix/dm-binary --cacher-mount /home/user/whonix/apt-cache -- ./derivative-maker <build arguments>
   ```
#### Hints
* Multiple custom commands can be chained with `&&` or `;`
* Using end of options `--` is recommended
